### Calculating energy from explosions
To calculate energy from explosions, you multiply the volume by the density of the explosive, multiply by the explosive energy density. <br/>
example: A pipe of 5 cm tall and 4 cm in diameter has a volume of 62.8cm^3, multiply that by an explosive density like TNT for example to get the grams 1.65g/cm^3. Now multiply by the energy density of the explosive (TNT) which is 4,184 Joules per gram. <br/>
The result is 433,546 Joules. If there are 6894.7573 newtons in 1 psi we can calculate that to 62.88 PSI. <br/>
You can use the <a href="https://potatochips2001.github.io/sound/" target="_blank">sound calculator</a> to calculate the decibels.
### list of explosives
TNT = 4184 Joules/gram & density = 1.65 g/cm^3 <br/>
RDX = 6000 Joules/gram & density = 1.82 g/cm^3 <br/>
Composition B (60/40 RDX/TNT) = 5200 Joules/gram & density = 1.65 g/cm^3 <br/>
Flash powder = 9200 Joules/gram & density = 0.8 g/cm^3 <br/>
Black powder = 3000 Joules/gram & density = 1.8 g/cm^3 <br/>
Uranium-235 (15 kg in a nuke) = 144,000,000 MJ/kg & density = 19.1 g/cm^3 <br/>
Hydrogen = 120 MJ/kg & density = 0.0701 g/cm^3 <br/>
Smokeless powder = 6,375 J/g & density = 1.6 G/cm^2 <br.>
Gasoline = 46 MJ/kg & density = 755 kg/m^3
### explosive damages to human body
2 PSI can possibly rupture ear drums <br/>
5 PSI ruptures ear drums (50%)<br/>
7.5 to 15 can lead to brain damage<br/>
14 PSI ruptures ear drums (100%) & possibly ruptures lungs<br/>
40 PSI ruptures lungs (50%) & can cause death <br/>
80 PSI ruptures intestines & ruptures 100% of lungs<br/>
100 PSI results in death almost always

"Hydrostatic shock is the controversial concept that a penetrating projectile (such as a bullet) can produce a pressure wave that causes "remote neural damage", "subtle damage in neural tissues" and/or "rapid incapacitating effects" in living targets." - Wikipedia <br/>
"In analysis of experiments of dogs shot in the thigh they report highly significant (p < 0.01), easily detectable neural effects in the hypothalamus and hippocampus with energy transfer levels close to 550 ft⋅lbf (750 J)." - Wikipedia <br/>
Energy transfered from a bullet to human body can result in brain damage and ruptured organs. It takes about 50 joules to cause brain damage and 80 joules for 50% chance of brain damage. <br/>
<b>Explosives</b> <br/>
If an explosive goes off it releases a lot of energy depending on the energy density of the chemical used, flash powder for example has an energy density of about 9,200 J/g, dividing ~6,900 from joules and you would get the PSI. 40 PSI has a 50% chance of rupturing lungs. <br/>
Decibels are on a log scale, so 10dB is 10x less energy, 20dB is 100x less energy, etc. Being behind a wall would reduce 30dB (own data from decibel readers), therefor an explosive's energy would be divided by 1,000. Larger walls (like brick walls) can reduce decibels by about 40dB. 40 PSI / 1,000 = 0.04 PSI, which makes a huge difference to being next to an explosion.

# Formulas
### Force time
A lot of people don't know this one so here <br/>
F<sub>avg</sub> = m * v / time <br/>
We can also use F<sub>avg</sub> = (0.5 * m * v<sup>2</sup>) / d <br/>
d is displacement
